         <p>EVERY year the scope of female labor is becoming broader, the number of laborers larger,
            the skill and the effectiveness of the working-women greater, but, unfortunately the
            condition of the women who win their bread has not improved. They are for the most
            part
            
            <span class="livingConditions">badly housed</span>, 
            <span class="livingConditions">insufficiently fed</span>,

            <span class="wageDesc">poorly paid</span>. The trades and the callings
            requiring skilled labor in which women are now employed in this country are mainly

            <br></br> of each of these articles the reader will perceive that the
            demand has brought about the supply. 
            <span class="womensLabor">There was need in each case for the manual
               dexterity, the light and careful touch and the patient and tireless application which
               we
               recognize as the chief advantages of women’s work.
            </span> For this peculiar ability, however,
            it is unfortnnately true that the women are the 
            <span class="wageDesc">worst paid
               laborers
            </span> in 
            <span class="placeName">America</span>. They receive 
            <span class="wageDesc">shamefully low wages</span>, and the conditions under which
            they work are disgraceful to our boasted civilization. For instance, 
            
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">braid-makers</span> average 
            <num type="wage" value="5.50">$5.50</num> a week;
            
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">vest-makers</span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="6.00">$6.00</num>;
            
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">button-hole makers</span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="4.30">$4.30</num>;
            
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">candy- makers</span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="4.75">$4.75</num>;
            
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">cap-makers</span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="5.50">$5.50</num>;
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">tobacco-strippers</span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="5.50">$5.50</num>; 
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">cigar-makers</span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="5.00">$5.00</num>;
            
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">dressmakers</span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="5.00">$5.00</num>;
            
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">hatters</span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="6.00">$6.00</num>; 
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">ladies’
               hat makers
            </span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="4.00">$4.00</num>;
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">paper-
               makers
            </span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="5.00">$5.00</num>;
            
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">rag-sorters</span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="3.50">$3.50</num>;
            
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">shirt-makers</span>, 
            <num type="wage" value="6.00">$6.00</num>. 
            These figures, however, come from first-class
            establishments, which are not afraid to expose their methods of working to the light
            of
            day; establishments which, unfortunately, are in a helpless minority among the employers
            of female labor. The writer believes, from a careful study of all the facts to which
            he
            could get access, that the 
            <span class="wageDesc">average wage for female skilled labor in
               this country, throughout, is somewhere between 
               <num type="wage" value="4.50">$4.50</num> and 
               <num type="wage" value="5.00">$5.00</num> a
               week, and the average time worked is something
               more than ten hours a day
            </span>. The reason is plain: 
            <span class="womensLabor">female labor is not organized,
               it is perfectly helpless, and the weakest, under the beneficent and kindly law of
               nature, goes to the wall.
            </span> 
         </p>
         <br></br>
         
         <p> There are classes of work done by women whose conditions can not in justice be
            criticised as can the so-called skilled labor, and which are, if not too well paid,
            at
            least comfortable, healthy, and proper; chief among these is domestic
            service, in which, in 1888, more than 1,200,000
            females are employed. 
            <span class="wageDesc">Their wages run between 
               <num type="wage" value="10.00">$10</num> and 
               <num type="wage" value="14.00">$14</num> a month some, of course, ranging
               as high as 
               <num type="wage" value="25.00">$25</num> and 
               <num type="wage" value="30.00">$30</num>, and few falling below
               
               <num type="wage" value="10.00">$10</num>, so that 
               <num type="wage" value="12.00">$12</num> is a conservative general
               average. To this is of course to be added board and lodging and perquisites, easily
               worth 
               <num type="wage" value="20.00">$20</num> a month more
            </span>. The 
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">domestic
               servant
            </span> is, as a rule, 
            <span class="livingConditions">well fed</span>,
            
            <span class="livingConditions">cleanly and comfortably lodged</span>, and fairly treated; but 
            <span class="womensLabor">the idea of household work is so
               repugnant to many women that they prefer the starvation wages of the trades and the
               unwholesome crowding of the tenements
            </span>. 
            <span class="referent" value="industry">Laundresses and hotel
               servants
            </span> have also surroundings and lives better for than anything to be
            found in the factories, but here, too, 
            <span class="womensLabor">the objection of “menial service” applies, and
               most 
               <span class="referent" value="nationality">American-born</span> women will have none of
               it.
            </span>
         </p>
         <br></br>
         
         <p> Up to within the past few years there was practically no recourse for an educated
            woman
            who had her own living to make save teaching. This 
            
            <pb n="15"></pb>

            list has also been extended, and 
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">type-writing</span>, which pays about 
            <num type="wage" value="10.00">$10</num> a week, 
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">stenography</span> at an
            average of 
            <num type="wage" value="12.00">$12</num>, and different kinds of
            
            <span class="referent" value="occupation">clerical work in stores, keeping books, cash, etc., and selling
               goods
            </span>, which are paid for at the rate of from 
            <num type="wage" value="5.50">$5.50</num> to 
            <num type="wage" value="10.00">$10</num>, and sometimes 
            <num type="wage" value="15.00">$15</num> a week, have been added to the list. So that on the whole there
            are now in 
            <span class="placeName">America</span> about one hundred separate callings bidding
            for female labor, out of which the woman who must win her bread may take her choice.
            That the theater for her endeavor has thus been widened is by itself a good thing.
            
            <span class="womensLabor">The
               chance for self-help, the possibility of independence, lifts the sex up, and as the
               years come on we can expect to see the sphere of woman’s action broadening until it
               at
               last will include all of these industries, where tactual skill, delicate manipulation,
               and careful work are needed rather than strength.
            </span> But before we congratulate ourselves
            too much upon the high civilization which this indicates, let, us look at the reverse
            of
            the picture.
         </p>
         <br></br>
         
         <p>It is a fact that 
            <span class="womensLabor">female labor the world over is in a most pitiable condition; women are
               weak in every way, weak individually and weak in their lack of organization, and there

            must stand appalled at the details. In 424 factories where women were employed in
            
            <span class="location">the east end of 
               <span class="placeName">London</span>
            </span>, sewer gas
            was present in dangerous quantities, and the
            sexes were huddled together without any attempt at decency. The places are described
            as foul and filthy. Among 600
            lost women who answered the questions put to them by the inspector, 511 had been
            factory operatives. The only wonder is that the proportion is not
            greater.
         </p>
         <br></br>
         
         <p> But we are accustomed to look on 
            <span class="placeName">London</span> as a place in another
            world. How is it at home? Here is the condition in 
            <span class="placeName">New York</span>
            tabulated so that it may be seen at a glance:

         <p>These are official figures, and the New York Labor Commissioner says
            officially of them: 
            <strong>
               <span class="quote">"It is not only proven that the sanitary condition such as to cause alarm, but
                  that, in an equally great proportion of the same buildings, means for prevention
                  and escape in case of fire are alarmingly deficient. And this is not all,
                  nor is it, from certain standpoints, a fact calculated to arouse public sentiment
                  and indignation to so great an extent, as the utter
                  lack of proper facilities for change of dress and the use of separate water
                  closets, as established by overwhelming testimony.“

               the conditions are as bad.
            </span> In many places where women work there is not even a pretense
            of cleanliness. It is proven that in one factory the women
            are locked in without any possibility of leaving the room for any purpose.
            When the

            <span class="placeName">St.

            <span class="workingClass">prostitution was one of the conditions of getting and keeping work, and that many
               girls could not make enough money to buy bread and fuel without resorting to the
               streets
            </span>. It is the general custom in almost all
            places to discipline women workers by fining them for an infraction of the rules,
            and there are many instances on record where the fines have taken up the whole of
            the week's wages, although the employer got the whole of the week’s work. Can
            anyone wonder that out of 2,000 women of the town in 
            <span class="placeName">New
               York

         <p>Tuesday, July 10, according to instructions, I made up
            for the role of shop-girl, and with a list of factories in one hand, and gentle
            peace in the other, sailed 
            <span class="location">down town</span> under a brown baize veil as impenetrable as an
            iron mask.

         <br></br>
         
         <p> I did not realize the

            with the single charm of good light. There is plenty of vacant room, but the
            women are huddled together, elbows touching, along the line of machines.
            Into the west windows pours the odor of 
            <span class="placeName">Chicago</span>’s
            famous sewer river; at the south end of the
            room, not ten feet from the crowded table, is a tier of closets, and on hot days
            the combined odor of the two is shocking. 
            <span class="workingClass">Nobody
               dare complain about smells, cold, heat, work, wages or rules. But whoever
               heard of martyrs complaining?

         <p> My experience began at 7:50 a.m. and lasted just three hours. When I climbed the
            dusty stairs I took a ten-minute rest at the top. Everybody was at work but
            a hungry-looking man about twenty-seven years old, with skin the color
            of a Russia turnip, and thin, peaked features. He was dressed in a pair of
            heelless slippers, a white shirt, and a pair of shop pants that some poor slave
            had received eighteen cents for making. Neither collar, vest, coat, nor
            suspenders burdened his emaciated form. He moved among the workers with
            a cat-like tread, his shoulders drooping and his knees opening and shutting with a
            sort of accordion movement at every step. He passed me several times as I stood at
            the desk, and eyed me so unpleasantly that I
            turned my back to him.
         </p>
         <br></br>
         
         <p>After waiting at the desk for three-quarters of an hour, I asked the clerk, a
            sweet little girl of sixteen years, with pretty red cheeks and dark eyelashes
            and hair, for work, and was told to wait till the forelady came round.
            A dozen girls were waiting, too, some with 
            <span class="referent" value="factoryItem">cloaks</span>, others with check-books and
            tickets, and a few with 
            <span class="referent" value="factoryItem">hand-made fringe</span>. The fringe girl I spoke
            to. She told me 
            <span class="wageDesc">she received 
               <num type="wage" value=".05">5 cents</num>
