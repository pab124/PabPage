      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>
    From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br/>
    That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br/>
    But as the riper should by time decease,<br/>
    His tender heir might bear his memory:<br/>
    But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br/>
    Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br/>
    Making a famine where abundance lies,<br/>
    Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br/>
    Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br/>
    And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br/>
    Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br/>
    And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:<br/>
    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br/>
    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

  </p>
      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>
        When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br/>
        And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br/>
        Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,<br/>
        Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:<br/>
        Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br/>
        Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br/>
        To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br/>
        Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br/>
        How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,<br/>
        If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br/>
        Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'<br/>
        Proving his beauty by succession thine!<br/>
        This were to be new made when thou art old,<br/>
        And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
    </p>
      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>
    Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest<br/>
    Now is the time that face should form another;<br/>
    Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br/>
    Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br/>
    For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb<br/>
    Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br/>
    Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,<br/>
    Of his self-love to stop posterity?<br/>
    Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee<br/>
    Calls back the lovely April of her prime;<br/>
    So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br/>
    Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br/>
    But if thou live, remember'd not to be,<br/>
    Die single and thine image dies with thee.

  </p>
      <h2>IV</h2>
      <p>
      Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend<br/>
      Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?<br/>
      Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,<br/>
      And being frank she lends to those are free:<br/>
      Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse<br/>
      The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br/>
      Profitless usurer, why dost thou use<br/>
      So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?<br/>
      For having traffic with thy self alone,<br/>
      Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:<br/>
      Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br/>
      What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<br/>
      Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br/>
      Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
