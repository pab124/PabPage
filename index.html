        <h2> Hello, and welcome to Patrick's webpage thing.</h2>
        <p>My name is Patrick and I'm currently learning about computer stuff. Here's a list of things that I like</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Languages (<a href="https://www.cnag.ie/ga/">Here</a> is where you can go to learn about the best language in the world)</li>
            <li>Outdoor things (hiking, canoeing, kayaking, fishing)</li>
            <li>Reading (favorite book - <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>)</li>
            <li>My dog (Tulio - yellowish)</li>
            <li>Traveling to Ireland (look what we found there this summer)<img src="TerribleIreland.jpg" alt="image of terrible towel in a pub in Connemara"/></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>More on the best language in the world</h2>
        <p> I'm partially biased to thinking this, because my granparents were native speakers and it's my favorite language i've learned thus far.</p>
        <h3>And <em>who wouldn't</em> want to learn a language where <i> go raibh maith agat</i> "thank you" is pronounced <i>"guh-REE-muh-gut"</i>?</h3>
