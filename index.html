        <h3> About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is <span class="name">Patrick</span> and I'm currently learning about computer stuff. Here's a list of things that I like</p>
        <div class="interests"><ul>
            <li>Languages (<a href="https://www.cnag.ie/ga/">Here</a> is where you can go to learn about the best language in the world)</li>
            <li>Outdoor things (hiking, canoeing, kayaking, fishing)</li>
            <li>Reading (favorite book - <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>)</li>
            <li>My dog (Tulio - yellowish)</li>
            <li>Traveling to Ireland (look what we found there this summer)<img src="TerribleIreland.JPG" alt="image of terrible towel in a pub in Connemara"/></li>
        </ul></div>
        <h3>More on Irish</h3>
        <div><p>I'm partially biased to thinking this, because my granparents were native speakers and it's my favorite language i've learned thus far.</p> <p>And <em>who wouldn't</em> want to learn a language where <i> go raibh maith agat</i> "thank you" is pronounced <i>"guh-REE-muh-gut"</i>?</p>
</div>    </body>
